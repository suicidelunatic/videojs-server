NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.080
Force and motion. In this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.666
activity, the students will use three different sized marbles to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.580
demonstrate how a greater force applied will move a cup further.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.594
(Visual: The video shows how the plastic cup moves

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.050
after interacting with marbles of different sizes.)

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.760
For this explore activity,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.810
students will need the following materials.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.520
Text on screen: Scissors, Modeling clay, Rolling pin,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.230
Paper plate, Plastic knife.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.920
Preparation. Flip the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.334
cup upside down and cut half circle opening at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9895

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.700
bottom of each cup.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9888

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.185
Each group will set up a ramp with the cup

NOTE Confidence: 0.9888

00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:33.630
upside down on the ramp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.800
The cup should be positioned at the lowest end of the ramp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.490
(Visual: The ramp is installed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.898
The cut off side of the cup is placed at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:40.380
the end of the inclined plane.)

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.848
Students will then predict in their

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.401
journal which marbel will move the cup the longest distance

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:46.890
and which one they think will move it the shortest.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.304
(Visual: The form for filling out the results

shown).

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.013
Groups will take turns placing each marble at the highest

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:54.600
point of the ramp and releasing it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.985
They will then place a sticker on the spot where

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:57.730
the cup moved.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.143
(Visual: The sticker is attached at the point where the cut

NOTE Confidence: 0.9887

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.350
part of the cup stopped).

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.610
They will then measure the distance moved,

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.370
making sure to use a different color each time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.883
For differentiation, students can measure the distance in centimeters with

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:11.260
a ruler or with paper clips.

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.180
(Visual: The measuring process

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.710
is shown with a ruler).

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.630
Repeat this process

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.080
with each sized marble using their student journals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.409
students will record the distance moved and sketch what happened

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.970
to each of the three marbles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.890
(Visual: Filling out the

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.069
form with sketching and writing the measurements have shown for three distances).

NOTE Confidence: 0.989

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.491
